bird detection app

This is Android app project where by using this app we are able to get info about various birds. 
For this app we have used ML also for train birds data set in kaggal. 
The model is trained by using transfer learning with pytorch and model save in pytorch with extension as pt or pth. 
After training and saving model there is necessary to pre-trained model and make the model optimize and fusable. 
We pre-trained model in jupeter notebook. 
After pre-training model we have to import in android and to use this model we have to use tenserflow.
